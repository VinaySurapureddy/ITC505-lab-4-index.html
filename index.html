            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The quality of content and the attractiveness of an environmental website can create an environmentally friendly attitude before one visits a secured area. Web applications, accessible via browsers over the Internet, have evolved significantly from static repositories to dynamic collaborative platforms. This study highlights advancements in web evaluation and modeling techniques like PROMETHEE II and its role in decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> A modern, sans-serif font is used for better readability, while headings have a slightly more decorative font for emphasis.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Size:</strong> Headings are larger and bolder to improve readability, with body text kept at an optimal reading size.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> Warm beige for background, deep burgundy for headers, coral for section headings, and lavender for the addendum background to create a balanced and engaging design.</li>
            <li><strong>Margins & Padding:</strong> Generous spacing around sections improves readability and layout clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> Proper use of <code>article</code> and <code>section</code> elements enhances accessibility and document structure.</li>
